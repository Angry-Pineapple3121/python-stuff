    "                        ☆ Nucleus ☆\n\n ★ Coordinates cell activities including growth,\n intermediary metabolism\n protein synthesis,\n and reproduction. ★",
    "            ☆ Cytoplasm ☆\n\n ★ A jelly-like solution that\n fills the inside of the cell and\n surrounds other important parts\n of the cell. ★",
    "                    ☆ Mitochondrion ☆\n\n★ Oblong-shaped organelles, found in the\n cytoplasm of cells. In the animal\n cell, they are\n the main source of power for the cell. ★",
    "                    ☆ Rough ER ☆\n\n ★ Has ribosomes on it, which help to\n make proteins for the cell. The Rough ER \n gets its name because of the ribosomes\n attached to it. ★",
    "                    ☆ Smooth ER ☆\n\n ★ The Smooth ER's job is to produce\n substances that are needed for the cell. ★",
    "                    ☆ Ribosome ☆\n\n ★ Tiny organelles are composed of 60%\n protein and 40% RNA. They help to\n make proteins and are attached \n to the Rough ER. ★",
    "                    ☆ Golgi Body ☆\n\n ★ Also known as a Golgi Apparatus, this\n organelle helps to process and package\n proteins and lipid molecules. ★",
    "                ☆ Cytoskeleton ☆\n\n ★ A structure that helps cells to keep\n their internal shape and provides\n mechanical support that assists\n in division and reproduction. ★",
    "                ☆ Plasma Membrane ☆\n\n ★ Found in all cells. Separates the interior\n of the cell from the outside\n environment. ★",
    "                        ☆ Centrioles ☆\n\n ★ Self-replacing organelles are made up of\n nine bundles of microtubules. They assist in\n organizing cell divison. ★",
    "                    ☆ Lysosome ☆\n\n ★ Think of a lysosome as a janitor.\n Lysosomes break down cellular waste and\n give the materials to the cytoplasm\n as new cell-building materials. ★",
    "                        ☆ DNA ☆\n\n ★ Contains all genetic information that is\n needed for reproduction and is essential\n for multiple cellular functions. ★",
    "                ☆ Nucleolus ☆\n\n ★ The nucleolus is inside the nucleus and is\n concerned with producing and assembling\n the cell's ribosomes. ★",
    "                        ☆ Vacuole ☆\n\n ★ Specialized lysosomes. They take in and\n get rid of waste products. They also\n assist in cell structure. ★"
