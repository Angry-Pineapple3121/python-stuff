# webhook-remover
deletes a webhook and sends a notification through a webhook of your choice

## instructions (like anyone needs these)
1) setup your webhook url
2) python3 main.py
3) enter a webhook and check your logs channel, you'll see:
  - the webhook was deleted successfully or if it was invalid
  - the webhook's data
  - a UUID for logging purposes honestly idk why I added this
  - time of deletion
