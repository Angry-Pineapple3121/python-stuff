# pastebin-scanner
scans a pastebin raw link for any discord webhooks and automatically deletes them

## instructions (like anyone needs these)
1) put in your pastebin url (must have a RAW tag in it)
2) set the cooldown in seconds of how often you want to scan
3) python3 main.py

this script was made mostly to scan for people using pastebin links that they could update remotely without having to recompile a jar file
